# Maze-Robot
 A maze Robot for solving mazes by using the wall's method strategy.
 
 This small robot is capable of solving any maze. Its algorithm was designed to win competitions by exploring different trajectories until ending at an exit or a certain point.

 The algorithm constantly uses interruptions to read ultrasonic sensors and performs a survey of the space in which it's located to make decisions.

 This held 2 competitions at the Technological University of Pereira, winning first place on the two occasions.
 The algorithm was carried out in C language, using the Pic C compiler development platform, a pic "16f887a" and general electronics mounting.
